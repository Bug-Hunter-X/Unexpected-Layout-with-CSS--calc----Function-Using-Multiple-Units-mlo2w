The CSS code has an unexpected behavior when using the `calc()` function with multiple units. For example, the following code results in an unexpected layout. 
```css
div {
  width: calc(50% - 10px);
  background-color: lightblue;
}
```
In some browsers, the calculation might be incorrect, resulting in an unexpected layout or rendering issues. This may be due to inconsistencies in the way different browsers interpret and handle the `calc()` function with mixed units.
